**Mads O'Brien** is an interdisciplinary environmental professional with over 6 years of GIS and remote sensing experience. She is passionate about advancing satellite imagery's role in natural resource management and disaster response, as well as low-cost and crowdsourced solutions to environmental data collection.

Mads is a recent graduate of the Yale School of the Environment. Her [master's thesis](/projects/2-yale-mesc-thesis) tests whether UAV-acquired carbon dioxide data can reduce uncertainties in urban emissions estimates. 

Previously, Mads worked as a research assistant at the United States Geological Survey's [California Volcano Observatory](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/california-volcano-observatory){:target="_blank"}, and as a [GIS tutor](https://library.stanford.edu/research/stanford-geospatial-center){:target="_blank"} at Stanford University. Outside of her formal career, she has lived the life of a property manager, a volunteer geophysicist, a student government representative, a camp counselor, an actor, and a nonprofit board member.
