#### Peer-reviewed Articles  
McCann, B. T., Davis, J., Osborne, D., Durham, C., **Oâ€™Brien, M.**, and Raymond, N. A. (2020). Quantifying climate change relevant humanitarian programming and spending across five highly disaster vulnerable countries. *Disasters.* [doi.org/10.1111/disa.12453](https://doi.org/10.1111/disa.12453). *(View on [ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/quantifying-climate-change-relevant-humanitarian-programming-and))*


The statistical findings from the paper were cited (page 17!) in a subsection of UN OCHA's [Global Humanitarian Overview 2020](https://www.unocha.org/global-humanitarian-overview-2020 "Global Humanitarian Overview 2020"). Yale School of Environment covered the study above on their [blog](https://environment.yale.edu/news/article/yaleled-study-cited-by-un-shows-lack-of-funding-for-climate-change-in-disaster-relief/) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EnvironmentYale/status/1225853881025990660). Our new friend Jo also gave us a shoutout in [her blog post](https://www.redr.org.uk/Blog/February/My-Five-Takeaways-from-the-Humanitarian-Networks-a) about HNPW 2020! 

#### Peabody Science Cafe
I moderated six panels and talks for the Yale Peabody Museum as a graduate student, and helped plan even more behind the scenes. When the Museum took its events online during the COVID-19 pandemic, I had the opportunity to moderate some of these talks virtually.
