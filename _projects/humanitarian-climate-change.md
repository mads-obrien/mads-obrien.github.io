### The Task / The Problem ###

The “Tracking Gap”:
Climate change is increasing the severity and frequency of natural hazards and associated disasters worldwide, yet there is little data dracking how and whether it is being addressed by humanitarian assistance programmes. In fact, there is currently no standard approach for how to track funding for climate change nor evaluate the impact of programmatic responses by humanitarian actors that relate to climate change. We undertook this study to address this “tracking gap”.
Continued delay in establishing a shared methodology for tracking and evaluating levels and allocation of climate change funding has potential consequences in limiting the coordination, efficiency, and outcomes of climate change initiatives.


### Our Approach: ###

This study pilots a novel prototyping a method for classifying spending practices based on programmatic data and vulnerability indexes compiled by UN OCHA (United Nations Office of Humanitarian Affairs). It proposes an initial framework to quantify donor expenditure, locate the
projects within the humanitarian cluster system, and determine which aspect of the Disaster Management Cycle (DMC) projects facilitate.
A total of 5558 proposed humanitarian projects from five selected countries during the timeframe of 2016– 2018 were analyzed. These countries are Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan, and Syria. Review of the program proposals illustrated a general lack of consensus on common
terminology to define climate change-related engagements. These methodologies can be expanded to additional countries and may be used to
understand how humanitarian climate change efforts evolve over time.

### Outcome highlights: ###
* Keyword search alone returned 1073 CCR (Climate Change-Related) projects; manual search by the authors returned 99 “true” CCR projects, resulting in a false-positive rate of 17.84%
* A higher proportion (60%) of climate projects carry a Food Security and Livelihoods (FS&L) cluster designation relative to the population of total projects.( 1.8% of projects included in humanitarian proposals reviewed by the study have a climate change-related component.
* Of 1361 funded projects, 40 of these projects (~3%) were climate related and received funding. As a whole, ~24% of all projects received funding . No distinct difference between CCR and non-CCR projects in the likelihood of being funded or the level of funding received.
