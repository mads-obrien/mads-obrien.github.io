## Visibility Analysis of Potential Solar Array ##

![A photo](http://placekitten.com/400/375)

**Duration:** July - August 2020  
**Affiliation:** Freelance / contractor  
**What:** Set of 3 maps for client's use in private meetings  
**My Role:** Sole analyst  

### The Task:

A client sought help determining the visibility of a solar array that their company was considering installing in the western United States.

With the limitations that the site must be within a certain distance of a substation and ---------------------. 

*Note: This project and location remains confidential at this time.*

### My Approach: 
* Create simple-to-understand maps of the company's existing property in the region of interest, depicting local roads and elevations. 
* Generating original shapefiles of desired acreges and shapes (circle, rectangle, etc.) for the client to visualize what a solar array of that size would look like on their property.
* Conduct a viewshed analysis from various viewpoints in a nearby town, and map the regions of visibility assuming solar panels are 10 ft high, 5 ft high, etc.
* Consult aeronautical charts to map all airspace restrictions of nearby airport.


### Outcome highlights
* Go back and forth with client under a short time frame with short turnaround.
* Educated the client about the limitations of the viewshed analysis with National Elevation Dataset numbers, and discussed the benefits of LIDAR level data.
