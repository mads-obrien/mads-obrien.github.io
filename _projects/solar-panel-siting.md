## Visibility Analysis of Potential Solar Array ##

![A photo](http://placekitten.com/400/375)

*Duration:* July - August 2020
*Affiliation:* Freelance / contractor  
*What:* Set of 3 maps for client's use in private meetings  
*My Role:* Sole analyst  

### The Task:

A client sought help determining the visibility of a potential solar array that their company was considering installing in the western United States.

Note: The project and location remains confidential at the moment.

### My Approach: 

* Had to consider distance to a substation

Used shapefiles of company held land

Viewshed analysis from various viewpoints in a nearby town.

Generating original shapefiles of a given acreage, for the client to visualize what a solar array of that size would look like on the ground.

Consult aeronautical charts to map all airspace restrictions of nearby airport.



### Outcome highlights
* 
* Educated the client about the limitations of the viewshed analysis with National Elevation Dataset numbers, and discussed the benefits of lidar level data.
