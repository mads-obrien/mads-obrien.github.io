**Duration:** Oct 2019 - Dec 2019  
**Affiliation:** David Rumsey Map Center  
**What:** Tutorial series for Map Center patrons, primarily academics  
**My Role:** Tutorial author

### The Task:

The David Rumsey Map Collection is widely accessed not only at its [physical home](https://library.stanford.edu/rumsey) at Stanford University but by folks around the world. The Map Center staff wished to create a guide for geospatial novices who want to use maps from the Rumsey collection for their own digital mapping projects.

In addition to an ArcGIS Online tutorial specific to using Rumsey maps, a walk-through of using the Georeferencer platform was long overdue. Though many georeferencing tools exist, DavidRumsey.com integrates with [Georeferencer](https://www.davidrumsey.com/view/georeferencer), a web service by Klokan Technologies. The platform enables "crowdsourced" georeferencing of thousands of maps in the collection.


### My Approach: 

I split this initiative into a series of three sequential tutorials that can be self-paced or taught live. **Tutorial #1** demonstrates how to georeference digitized Rumsey maps online; **Tutorial #2** demonstrates how to import these maps into ArcGIS Online straight from DavidRumsey.com; **Tutorial #3** is a fairly standard introduction to creating symbology and popups in an AGO webmap.

Many of the patrons who use the center are historians and humanists, who may not have much experience in the digital humanities. While there are multiple techniques for approaching the task (the art?) of georeferencing, I tried a bunch of different approaches myself to narrow in on what methods would seem the most intuitive given the quirks of the platform(s) used.

### Outcome highlights
* Wrote very generally for a non-technical audience, assuming no prior geospatial knowledge
* Illustrated how to make numerous platforms and workflows work together, including Georeferencer, LUNA viewer (on DavidRumsey.com), web map tile services (WMTS), ArcGIS Online community data, and custom user shapefiles
* Crafted an annoted "teacher's edition" of each tutorial, to help other Map Center employees run the workshops after my departure from the Center
* Created some "rules of thumb" to indicate when one is *done* georeferencing an image and how to assess its quality--guidance that is not currently offered in the davidrumsey.georeferencer.com interface.
