Data sources: 
I used UAS imagery shared with me by Angie Dieffenbach (CVO, USGS). 
The images were the ones used 

The data release that talks about the images? Features some of them, and video? https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5d92dd71e4b0c4f70d0d1cac

### The Objective:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

* Create a 3D mesh model and digital elevation model (DEM) of the F8 spatter cone and lava channel from two UAV flights, taken 7 days apart
* Georeference a 3D model whose input images lack GPS coordinates
* Calculate the volume of differences in the F8 cone between both acquisition dates
* Assess the height and terrain of the F8 cone in the UAV-derived models, relative to a LIDAR-derived surface measured earlier in Summer 2018
* Create cross-sections of F8 from all dates to visualize and quantify changes


### The Solution:

Cross section lines were drawn in ArcMap across regions of potential surface change suggested by the analyses above. Elevation profiles were generated for each line using the Stack Profile 3D Analyst tool in ArcMap, and profiles for July, August, and September were plotted simultaneously.

### Outcome highlights
* Lava lake appeared sometime between Aug 27 and Sept 2 amounting to 13,066.114197 m3 (+- 28.09 m3). Under the assumption of lava infill starting on Sept 1, estimated rate of lava fill is 363 m3 per hour.
* Two zones of significant channel shallowing developed between July and Aug 27, likely due to pooling slow-moving lava hardening into basalt rock.
* The area of the crater floor as of Sept 1 matches the size of the crater floor in our Aug 27 flight almost exactly, affirming that UAV imagery flown with these parameters are effective for producing useful models for earth scientists.
