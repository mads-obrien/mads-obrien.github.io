**Duration:** July - August 2020  
**Affiliation:** Freelance / contractor  
**What:** Set of 3 maps for client's use in private meetings  
**My Role:** Sole analyst  

### The Task:

--> *Note: This project and location remains confidential at this time.* <--

A client's company was considering installing a solar array on its property in the western United States. First and foremost, the client wished to better visualize how much area these arrays would take up when talking to solar developers, and what shape of arrays could fit in various parcels of their land. The client also wished to understand the visibility of the potential array from a nearby town and rural homes. 


### My Approach: 
* Create simple-to-understand maps of the company's existing property in the region of interest, depicting local roads and land elevations. 
* Generate arbitrary shapefiles of desired acreges and shapes (circle, rectangle, etc.) for the client to visualize how a solar array of that size would appear on their property, adhering to location constraints like distance from a substation. 
* Conduct a viewshed analysis from various viewpoints in a nearby town, and map the regions of visibility assuming different heights of solar panels (e.g., 7ft, 14 ft)
* Consult aeronautical charts to map all airspace restrictions of nearby airport.


### Outcome highlights
* Iterate drafts with client within a firm time frame.
* Educated the client about the limitations of the viewshed analysis using National Elevation Dataset numbers, and discussed the benefits of LIDAR level data.
* Viewshed analysis indicated greater visibility of the solar array sites than anticipated
