### The Problem ###

Climate change is increasing the severity and frequency of natural hazards and associated disasters worldwide. Yet, there is little data tracking how and whether climate change is being addressed by humanitarian assistance programs. In fact, there is currently no standard approach for tracking funding for, or evaluating the impact of, programmatic responses by humanitarian actors that relate to climate change. These methodologies can be expanded to additional countries and may be used to
understand how humanitarian climate change efforts evolve over time.

Inspired by co-author Jenna Davis's final paper in [Nathaniel Raymond's](https://jackson.yale.edu/person/nathaniel-raymond/) course *Humanitarian Aid*, a team of students undertook this study to address this “tracking gap”.


### Our Approach: ###

At its core, this project was text analysis: in absence of a definition for which humanitarian projects consider climate change or not, we created our own definition informed. i.e., If a request for funding contains 2+ vetted key words from the humanitarian aid literature, it is categorized as a climate change related project. 

To test our classification method, my teammates scraped 5000+ official requests for humanitarian funding, from five selected countries, between 2016– 2018. Funding requests meeting the 2+ keyword threshold were selected using VBA/Excel, then (god love em!) my coauthors *manually read* the resulting 1000+ funding requests to determine whether the project truly related to climate change.

### Outcome highlights: ###

Check out the [paper abstract](https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/quantifying-climate-change-relevant-humanitarian-programming-and) for some of our key take-away statistics. Some teasers: **Only 1.8%** of projects included in humanitarian proposals reviewed by the study feature a climate change related component. However, it appears climate vs. non-climate related projects still carry the same likelihood of receiving funding.

Below are some of my specific contributions to the project.

* Clarifying and justifying our new (and sometimes not straightforward) methodology in our manuscript. In addition to articulating the method in writing, I created a summary flow-chart to aid reader comprehension, seen above.
* Served as the unofficial "data analysis advisor" on the team and guided what statistics would be most useful to interrogate our question. Example: I insisted we calculate and include the false-positive rate (17.84%) of our classification method, to quantitatively discuss how it could improve.
* Double-checked summary statistics calculated by our lead author with my own analysis.
* Responsible for final "paper optics" before submission, including formatting and citations.
* Co-presented our findings at Humanitarian Network Partnerships Week 2020 in Geneva, Switzerland.
* My coauthors and I also met with various stakeholders at ICRC, UN OCHA to discuss this pilot study and solicit advice for future projects.
