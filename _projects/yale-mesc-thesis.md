### The Task:

My unofficial PI, Dr. Natalie Schultz, received a grant from the Connecticut Space Grant Consortium to pilot (no pun intended) a new method for estimating CO2 flux in cities via a sensor-laden UAV platform. I collaborated with her as the first research assistant on the grant. 

### My Approach:

We did a lot of things. A lot of this phase being platform development and testing…. More robust field flight campaigns are a step for later.
We experimented with instrument placement, to find ideal spot for mounting the sensors on the UAV to avoid the effect of rotor wind. 


### Outcome highlights
* Based on our literature review, we also calibrated our small, cheap CO2 sensor against a high accuracy one using multiple regression. Wrote a script to convert our “raw” CO2 measurements in the field to the “corrected” ones, based on the parameters (constants) from the regression. CODE SNIPPET?
