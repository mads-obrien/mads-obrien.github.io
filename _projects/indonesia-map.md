**Duration:** March 2019  
**Affiliation:** Yale School of Environment  
**What:** Print-ready map  
**My Role:** Cartographer

### The Task

A history professor and Yale alumnus, [Kevin Fogg](http://www.kevinwfogg.net/), sought a GIS freelancer to create a map for his upcoming book. The map is one of the few lineart figures in the manuscript and aims to communicate the location of the regions discussed in the text--no frills. 

### My Approach

I used public domain [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) shapes to produce a low-profile outline of Indonesia, with geometry edits to include new Indonesian provinces created after the latest data. I altered label placement and drop shadows in Adobe Illustrator and ultimately exported the image as a vector / SVG to the publisher.

### Outcome Highlights

* Produced professional-looking map with quick turnaround time
* Iterated drafts quickly with the client
* Adhered to figure production guidelines from a major publishing company
