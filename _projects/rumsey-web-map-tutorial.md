*Duration:* Oct 2019 - Dec 2019  
*Affiliation:* David Rumsey Map Center  
*What:* Tutorial series for patrons  
*My Role:* Tutorial author

### The Task:

The David Rumsey Map Collection is widely accessed not only at its [physical home at Stanford University](https://library.stanford.edu/rumsey) but by folks around the world. The Map Center wished to create a guide for novices who wanted to georeference maps from the Rumsey collection for their own projects.

The series of three tutorials--either self-paced or taught live--demonstrate how to georeference digitized Rumsey maps online as well as import those maps into ArcGIS Online.

Though many tools for georeferencing exist, DavidRumsey.com integrates with [Georeferencer](https://www.davidrumsey.com/view/georeferencer), a service by Klokan Technologies. The platform allows for "crowdsourced" georeferencing of thousands of maps in the collection.


### My Approach: 

Many of the patrons who use the center are historians and humanists, who may not have much experience in the digital humanities. There are multiple ways to approach the task (the art?) of georeferencing, but in this tutorial we present the method that is easiest given the Georeferencer online platform, after I tried a bunch of different methods.

To avoid writing "yet another introduction to ArcGIS Online," I catered the guide specifically to using maps from the expansive David Rumsey collection.


### Outcome highlights
* There are multiple ways to approach the task (the art?) of georeferencing, but in this tutorial we present the method that is easiest given the Georeferencer online platform, after I tried a bunch of different methods.
* Wrote very generally for a non-technical audience, assuming no prior geospatial knowledge
* Created an annoted "teacher's edition" of each tutorial, to help other Map Center employees run the workshops after my departure
* Described how to incorporate numerous different platforms -- Georeferencer, LUNA viewer (davidrumsey.com), ArcGIS Online maps that use WMTS tiles, ArcGIS Online community data, and custom user shapefiles
