*Duration:* Oct 2019 - Dec 2019  
*Affiliation:* David Rumsey Map Center
*What:* Tutorial series for patrons 
*My Role:* Tutorial author

### The Task:

Goal was to create a guide for novices who wanted to georeference maps from the Rumsey collection. Series of 3 tutorials, showing people how to georeference online (and contribute to the crowd sourced effort!) as well as an intro to importing those maps into ArcGIS Online

There are tons of different tools for georeferencing, but this one was to be a guide for the georeferencing platform that DavidRumsey.com had integrated directly into its website. Also pairs with a "crowdsourcing" platform so you can compare who has made the most contributions

### My Approach: 

Many of the patrons who use the center are historians and humanists, who may not have much experience in the digital humanities. There are multiple ways to approach the task (the art?) of georeferencing, but in this tutorial we present the method that is easiest given the Georeferencer online platform, after I tried a bunch of different methods.

I didn't want to write "just another AGO introduction" tutorial. I catered it specifically to using maps from the expansive David Rumsey collection


### Outcome highlights
* There are multiple ways to approach the task (the art?) of georeferencing, but in this tutorial we present the method that is easiest given the Georeferencer online platform, after I tried a bunch of different methods.
* Wrote very generally for a non-tech audience, assuming no prior knowledge
* Added instructor comments to the document, to help other employees run the workshop after my departure
* AGO: Write instructions to incorporate multiple different platforms -- Georeferencer.com, LUNA viewer (davidrumsey.com), ArcGIS Online maps that use WMTS tiles, AGO Community data, and custom user shapefiles
